```js
let num = 5;
let newNum = num++;
newNum = ++num;
```

## My Solution

1. In first Line we are declaring and initializing the variable `num` with the value `5`.
2. In the second line we are declaring and initializing the variable `newNum` with the expression.
3. The expression is excuted by the unary operator named post increment means first use then change.
4. The value of `newNum` will be `5`.
5. The value of `num` will be `6`.
6. In third line we are replacing the `newNum` 's value to an another expression which is `++num`.
7. The value of `newNum` will be `7`
8. The value of `num` will be `7`
9. Because at first the value of `num` was `10` then it was post increment first used in `newNum` and changed in `num` no replacing the value of `newNum` with pre increment.
